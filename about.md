Hi! I'm Jack and I'm a 22-year-old branding and PR strategist currently based out of beautiful Boulder, CO. 

I've worked over the past 5 years to develop esports in Colorado by: building my university's flagship [gaming club](https://cugaming.gg/), consulting with universities on gaming and esports, and hosting a /ton/ of events.

These days I'm continuing to bring my expertise to a variety of brands within the gaming and esports industries. 


Nice to meet you.

## Mission
<p style="text-align:center"><span class="evidence">Use the power of games to celebrate the human experience.</span></p>

Games have the unique ability to connect people ignoring the traditional cultural barriers that are placed between them by society. Gender, race, age, status, language, disability, and so much more disappear when you escape into an in-depth world or a high-stakes competition.

Games are my life and I want to give everyone the opportunity to make a new friend, cheer for their favorite team, and break free of the everyday.
